The foundation of proposed system is a resume automation system. Concerning
the project, there will be an admin panel at first, into which the administrator must initially
log in. 
Following that, there will be a section for uploading gathered resumes, which the
admin will manage. Finally, the extracted information or .txt file is saved in the New folder
by admin if necessary.
Converting a resume into prepared text or structured information makes studying, analyzing, and comprehending easier. As a result, many organizations and institutions
depend on Information Extraction, where unstructured data and vital information are extracted and converted to make information more readable and organized data forms
